# Exploring-London-s-Travel-Network

Use SQL to analyze a database containing information about Transport for London journeys over 12 years! 

Source problem from Datacamp 

Project Description
How do Londoners get around? Transport for London (TfL) is a vast public transport network that allows London's residents to efficiently travel around the UK's capital, to the tune of over 1.5 million journeys per day!

In this introductory project, I will work with a Google BigQuery database containing data on journeys and transport types in London between 2010 and 2022. I will write SQL queries to find the most popular transport methods, examine when the Emirates Airline cable car (which connects London's Royal Docks, where the Mayor's office is located, to Greenwich Peninsula, home of the O2 arena) was particularly busy, and identify rare periods when the Underground (also known as "the tube" to locals) was less busy.
